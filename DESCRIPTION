Description: Implementation of gene-level rare variant association tests targeting allelic series: genes where increasingly deleterious mutations have increasingly large phenotypic effects. The COding-variant Allelic Series Test (COAST) operates on the benign missense variants (BMVs), deleterious missense variants (DMVs), and protein truncating variants (PTVs) within a gene. COAST uses a set of adjustable weights that tailor the test towards rejecting the null hypothesis for genes where the average magnitude of effect increases monotonically from BMVs to DMVs to PTVs.
